One traditional approach is to date it whenever you send it out. I chose to present my CV on my website and host it on GitHub.

The book &lt;em>How Google works&lt;/em> covers many aspects of the companies culture. The book has lots of management insights that - at the time of reading - were of little interest to me. Therefore I want to briefly highlight a few points about &lt;a href="#innovation">innovation&lt;/a> that I find fascinating and then move to the human factors like &lt;a href="#recruiting">recruiting&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="#competence-management">competence management&lt;/a> that are also covered extensively in the book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
