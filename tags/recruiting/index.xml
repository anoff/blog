One traditional approach is to date it whenever you send it out. I chose to present my CV on my website and host it on GitHub. In this blog post I want to explain how I set up continuous integration pipeline for building my CV that automatically injects a unique version into each build. This method is applicable for anyone choosing to ascii-based CV - in my case LaTeX.</description></item><item><title>What I learned about Management and Recruiting</title><link>https://blog.anoff.io/2019-01-31-book-google-schmidt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.anoff.io/2019-01-31-book-google-schmidt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/2019-01-15-book-2018-in-books&#34;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; my book series will start with two books out of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google&#34;&gt;FAANG&lt;/a&gt; league. The book &lt;em&gt;How Google works&lt;/em&gt; covers many aspects of the companies culture. The book has lots of management insights that - at the time of reading - were of little interest to me. Therefore I want to briefly highlight a few points about &lt;a href=&#34;#innovation&#34;&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt; that I find fascinating and then move to the human factors like &lt;a href=&#34;#recruiting&#34;&gt;recruiting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#competence-management&#34;&gt;competence management&lt;/a&gt; that are also covered extensively in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
