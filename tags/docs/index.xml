My previous post blog.anoff.io/2019-02-15-antora-first-steps covered basics of Antora and how to migrate existing AsciiDoc files. In this post I will go through the steps of including content from another repository, building a custom UI and adding plantUML support to the (automated, dockerized) build.
plantUML supportOne of the most important things for me when it comes to software docs is the ability to show relationships and interactions using diagrams.</description></item><item><title>Get Hugo to render (nice) Asciidocs</title><link>https://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-17-hugo-render-asciidoc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-17-hugo-render-asciidoc/</guid><description>While migrating my blog from Jekyll to Hugo I went down quite a rabbit hole.

The main reason for the interest in AsciiDoc was the fact that the limited feature set in markdown often impairs you while writing down complex things. But I had one problem; most of our documentation is scattered across multiple repositories as we try to keep the docs as close to the code as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
