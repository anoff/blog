This blog post will cover how to setup a Raspberry Pi with Docker support.
It will also cover some basic steps that will make it easier to work with your RasPi later on.
This setup will work completely without monitor/keyboard for your Raspberry but you need a LAN connection to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programming ESP and other Arduino compatible chips using VS Code on MacOS</title><link>https://blog.anoff.io/2020-12-programming-arduino-esp-with-vs-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.anoff.io/2020-12-programming-arduino-esp-with-vs-code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you are developing microcontroller based projects as a hobbyist you often end up with the Arduino ecosystem and might be tempted to use their IDE.
This post will explain how you can develop, program &amp;amp; debug Arduino compatible devices using VS Code.
Even though this post is written with a MacOS walk-through it should be valid for other operation systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
