My personal decision was to host all my personal projects on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/anoff&#34;&gt;🦑 GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. For projects that need CI/CD I tinkered around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;👷‍ Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://circleci.com/&#34;&gt;🅾️ Circle CI&lt;/a&gt; on top of GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
