The book &lt;em&gt;How Google works&lt;/em&gt; covers many aspects of the companies culture. The book has lots of management insights that - at the time of reading - were of little interest to me. Therefore I want to briefly highlight a few points about &lt;a href=&#34;#innovation&#34;&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt; that I find fascinating and then move to the human factors like &lt;a href=&#34;#recruiting&#34;&gt;recruiting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#competence-management&#34;&gt;competence management&lt;/a&gt; that are also covered extensively in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My year 2018 in books</title><link>//blog.anoff.io/2019-01-15-book-2018-in-books/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//blog.anoff.io/2019-01-15-book-2018-in-books/</guid><description>For the last ~15 months I spent a lot of wasted time (commuting to work, waiting at the doctors, sitting on planes) with audio books. I have never been a big reader and the entry barrier to start listening to a book instead of music is a lot lower than packing books, reading instead of listening etc. That&amp;rsquo;s why I became a really big fan of listening to various audiobooks.</description></item></channel></rss>
