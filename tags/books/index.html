<span class=author><a href=/author/anoff>anoff</a></span></div><p>As <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2019-01-15-book-2018-in-books">promised</a> my book series will start with two books out of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google>FAANG</a> league. The book <em>How Google works</em> covers many aspects of the companies culture. The book has lots of management insights that - at the time of reading - were of little interest to me. Therefore I want to briefly highlight a few points about <a href=#innovation>innovation</a> that I find fascinating and then move to the human factors like <a href=#recruiting>recruiting</a> and <a href=#competence-management>competence management</a> that are also covered extensively in the book.</p><h2 id=innovation>Innovation</h2><p><img src=/assets/book-google/sharon-pittaway-117630-unsplash.jpg width=50% class=left></p><blockquote><p>Photo by Sharon Pittaway on Unsplash</p></blockquote><p>The book makes some clear statements about what innovation really means for Google and might help you differentiate between bullshit bingo and real innovation:</p><ol><li>Giving customers what they want is <strong>not innovative</strong><ul><li>Relates to the Henry Ford (<a href=https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast>or not</a>) quote <code>‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù</code></li><li>Instead surprise customers and provide something fundamentally useful they did not have before</li></ul></li><li>Multiple small non-innovative steps combined can lead to innovative products<ul><li>One example given here is Google Mail that was not an innovation per se but the combination of cloud storage, web applications, artificial intelligence created a product that entered an existing market and disrupted it</li></ul></li><li>Innovators do not need to be told that they should be innovative<ul><li>Innovation is not learned it is a personality trait</li><li>You can foster innovation but you can not learn or <em>command</em> it</li><li>To achieve true innovation give innovators freedom to operate (time, resources, trust)</li></ul></li><li>Large corporations attract <strong>risk-avoiding employees</strong> that often tend to hinder innovation<ul><li>Employees that seek a safe place hardly embrace change and even less actively bring it into an organization</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=management>Management</h2><p><img src=/assets/book-google/rawpixel-743066-unsplash.jpg width=50% class=right></p><blockquote><p>Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash</p></blockquote><p>As mentioned before there are a lot of management aspects covered in this book that did not make it into my personal notes. I might have to read those up again at some point. One deduction that stuck with me is about processes in an innovative environment:</p><ol><li><code>&quot;If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough.&quot;</code> (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Andretti>Mario Andretti</a>, Race car driver)<ul><li>In this context: If you do not experience any problems you are not innovating as much as you could</li></ul></li><li><strong>Processes are slower than reality</strong><ul><li>YES, YES, YES</li></ul></li><li>Chaos is the normal not an exception<ul><li>In an innovative environment what you consider realistic might change any day</li></ul></li><li>Order and processes can not be enforced<ul><li>Even in innovative environments you need to establish some <em>rules</em></li><li>These rules need to be decided and implemented by everyone involved from top management to junior employee</li><li>To have this open discussion and decision making you need to have a culture of <strong>openness, transparency, meritocracy and honesty</strong></li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=recruiting>Recruiting</h2><p><img src=/assets/book-google/ryoji-iwata-697773-unsplash.jpg width=50% class=left></p><blockquote><p>Photo by Ryoji Iwata on Unsplash</p></blockquote><p>A term that keeps reappearing in the book is <strong>the smart creative</strong> that is described a person that belongs to</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[..] the ambitious ones <strong>of all ages</strong> who are eager (and able) to use the tools of technology to do a lot more. Their common characteristic is that they work hard and are <strong>willing to question the status quo</strong> and attack things differently. This is why they can have such an impact.
It is also why they are uniquely difficult to manage, especially under old school models, because no matter how hard you try, you <strong>can‚Äôt tell people like that how to think</strong>. If you can‚Äôt tell someone how to think, then you have to learn to manage the environment where they think and to make it a place where they want to come every day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This definition resonates so well with me because after reading it I realized that all the people I look up to within my personal network are not willing to accept the status quo and keep asking <em>Why do we need to do it this way?</em>. I fought many battles myself, often I was close to giving up but in the end being persistent in your will to change something you will most likely succeed. Too often things are done in ways that are based on assumptions that are no longer valid or might not be applicable for you. Keep in mind to <strong>stay constructive</strong> when going up against established rules though - try to understand their reasoning and explain why you think it may not apply to your cause. Playing naive also helps üòâ</p><p>The main points that the book makes about hiring such smart creatives are:</p><ol><li>Hire people that are life long learners<ul><li>People you do not have to train for the new upcoming technology but those that want to bring it in and learn it out of curiosity</li><li>One point I take away from this is to read CVs more carefully regarding things like off-work trainings, pet projects etc.</li></ul></li><li>Generalists over experts<ul><li>The reasoning is that IT changes so quickly it is likely the field you are an expert in now may no longer be relevant to the industry, your product or your company in the future. It is more important to excel at learning new concepts than to already master them.</li></ul></li><li>Hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team<ul><li>This aspect might be controversial but given the reasoning I think it makes sense - and is <em>too often</em> ignored</li><li>People you like <em>as friends</em> share your interests and your views on things</li><li>This results in little diversity in opinions and paths of reasoning</li><li>Without diversity you will never have <em>all possible options</em> on the table when you need to make a decision</li><li>This might lead to a sub-optimal decision because the best solution was not considered</li><li>It matters more that you are able to have an interesting (objective) discussion with someone than to like them (LAX rule)</li></ul></li><li>Hiring is every employees responsibility<ul><li>To get the best you need to cast a wide net</li><li>Every employee should be looking for new talent</li><li>Make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for everyone, not just HR</li></ul></li><li>Always hire <em>the best</em><ul><li>Train your employees to hire people they look up to</li><li>Once you start hiring someone you consider <em>only good</em> and they themselves start hiring the collective skill will spiral downwards</li><li><strong>Never</strong> settle for good</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=competence-management>Competence Management</h2><p><img src=/assets/book-google/hello-i-m-nik-687249-unsplash.jpg width=50% class=right></p><blockquote><p>Photo by Hello I&rsquo;m Nik on Unsplash</p></blockquote><p>One point from the recruiting category also has a big impact on the competence management of employees. <strong>Life long learning</strong> is something that needs to be enabled, supported and fostered by the organization. If you hire <em>smart creatives</em> they will leave as soon as they realize there is nothing new to learn or - even worse - that learning new things might be frowned upon as <em>wasting time</em>.</p><p>Another point made in the book that I find extremely tempting to implement in my own environment is the concept of <strong>snippets</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Every</strong> employee writes a short weekly summary of what they were working on<ul><li>Project managers might write about customers they talked about</li><li>Developers write about tools they learned or bugs they found</li></ul></li><li>0.5 - 1 page per week, bullet points</li><li>Share it openly with everyone in your company<ul><li>The organization needs to provide a central infrastructure where people can store their snippets</li><li>Do not mail it to your manager</li><li>Snippets need to be searchable by fulltext and person</li></ul></li><li>If you are interested in a persons work, just look up their past snippets to see what they are working on exactly</li><li>If you are looking for someone that might help you with <em>XY</em> just search the snippets for it</li></ol><p>I think the act of writing these snippets is very little overhead to ones daily work if you get used to it but it can be such a powerful tool to boost network opportunities and knowledge exchange.</p><hr><p>Let me know if you liked this article or which parts you find especially fascinating by leaving a comment below, on <a href=https://twitter.com/anoff_io>Twitter</a> or message me on <a href=https://linkedin.com/in/offenhaeuser>LinkedIn</a></p><p>Stay tuned for the best parts of <code>Powerful</code></p><p>üëã Andreas</p></div><div class=footer><div class=tags><i class="fa fa-tags"></i><div class=links><a href=/tags/books>books</a>

<span class=author><a href=/author/anoff>anoff</a></span></div><p>For the last ~15 months I spent a lot of wasted time (commuting to work, waiting at the doctors, sitting on planes) with audio books. I have never been a big reader and the entry barrier to start listening to a book instead of music is a lot lower than packing books, reading instead of listening etc. That&rsquo;s why I became a really big fan of listening to various audiobooks.</p><p>Years ago I listened to a lot of books by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach>Andreas Eschbach</a> which I still love for their amazing worlds that are somewhat SciFi but also very realistic. They do not build an entire new civilization with new kinds of lifeforms, instead they alter one tiny detail e.g. humans mastered nano robots or growing oil from bacteria. My all time favorite is <a href=https://www.amazon.de/Lord-All-Things-Andreas-Eschbach/dp/1477849815>Lord of all things [not a referral]</a>.</p><h2 id=motivation>Motivation</h2><p>Over the last months I mainly listened to audiobooks for learning instead of entertainment. I focus on the following areas:</p><ul><li>team culture</li><li>leadership in tech</li><li>entrepreneurship / innovation</li><li>biographies of interesting (IT) people</li><li>impact of tech on ethics and social norms</li></ul><p>As most people do, after getting new ideas from many books I like to talk with friends and colleagues what I would like to change in my life according to the things I just learned. In this blog series I want to share these ideas with you.
My goal is not to provide a book review per-se but to share the things that are the <strong>major learnings</strong> for me personally.</p><h2 id=my-books-in-2018>My books in 2018</h2><p>I will kick off this series with an overview of the books I went through in 2018 and late 2017.
Since I did not keep notes on all the books some might only have very short opinion on it.</p><h3 id=elon-musk-how-the-billionaire-ceo-of-spacex-and-tesla-is-shaping-our-future>Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future</h3><p><code>by Ashlee Vance</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/musk.jpg class=right></p><p>After the hype around SpaceX Falcon launch I wanted to learn more about <a href=https://twitter.com/elonmusk>Elon Musk</a> - especially his past and how he got to the point where he runs several big firms with an incredible impact on humanity. This <strong>biography</strong> does a good job at this and also claims to be the only one that actually got Musk to give info/feedback about his biography.</p><p>The book starts off with Musks youth in South Africa and eventually tells the story of his first entrepreneurial steps with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2>Zip2</a> something that could have been google maps and his online payment startup that - by selling it - allowed him to start Tesla Inc.</p><p>There is a <a href=https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html>great blog post</a> out there trying to give an explanation on Elon Musks overall strategy when it comes to his various companies. It gives far better food for thought than the biography I read - altough the bio is great to get more insights on his early years.</p><h3 id=rework>Rework</h3><p><code>by Jason Fried &amp; David Heinemeier Hansson</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/rework.jpg class=left></p><p>This book is packed with tips for <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>. In my opinion the advice given in this book is very thorough but only fits for a specific kind of enterprise - those that are similar to Davids own Basecamp.</p><p>My main take away from this book is the <strong>benefit of having a simple product</strong>. Besides the product and its codebase being <em>easier to maintain</em> a simple product also means <em>onboarding new customers</em> is easy because they do not have to jump through many hoops to get the product into use.</p><h4 id=1-simple-products-lead-to-happy-customers>1. Simple products lead to happy customers</h4><p>The more complex your product the harder it is to describe what it does. This may lead to miscommunication with (new) customers that get a product that does not fully meet their expectations. The simpler your product the easier to understand is it for its users.
This already shows one limitation of the range of products these tips can be applied to; the aspect of clarity of product specification is relevant if you are in a B2C environment and people need to learn about your product in a self guided manner. If you work in B2B scenarios this aspect might not be as relevant because you have less customers to provide information to and can therefore use marketing and sales people to help with targeted customer communication.</p><h4 id=2-diversity-kills-product-focus>2. Diversity kills product focus</h4><p>Keep your product simple and do not add features that might blend into another product. Similar to the onboarding benefit of having a simple product, having a confined set of features and use cases makes sure you have a homogenous customer base. This makes it easier to keep those customers happy as they all expect your product to do the same thing. If you change something it is likely that all users take the change equally positive/negative.</p><p>One example for failing this rule is Microsoft&rsquo;s Excel. From high schoolers to soccer moms to professional accountants to data scientists - everyone uses Excel for many different purposes expecting the product to be able to do different things. Excel does a pretty good job at it but managing changes to such a product must be an incredibly complex job. You definitely do not want this complexity in your startup.</p><h4 id=3-ignore-80-of-the-feature-requests>3. Ignore 80% of the feature requests</h4><p>Of course it is important to listen to your users. But to keep your product simple you should put a lot of thought into which features you bring out. A simple rule is <strong>prioritize feedback by frequency not by volume</strong>. Add features that most of your customers want - not the ones that few people scream for very loudly. This is a tough principle to follow as it might lead to losing customers.</p><p>If you have a customer that makes up a significant amount of revenue you need to carefully consider if you can afford losing them for the sake of simplicity. If your startup is still in its growth phase it might be acceptable to lose larger customers.</p><h3 id=alibaba-the-house-that-jack-ma-built>Alibaba: The house that Jack Ma built</h3><p><code>by Duncan Clark</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/alibaba.jpg class=right></p><p>After learning about the CEO of Tesla and Microsoft I decided to take a peek at the other side of the globe and binged the <strong>biography</strong> of Alibabas CEO Jack Ma.
Before listening to this book I thought I was somewhat aware of the size of the Ali empire; but I was wrong. This book starts off by detailing Alibabas birth and how Jack Ma never sought to compete with Amazon or eBay (B2C) but instead focus on the B2B market to offer a marketplace to the diverse and growing manufacturing industry in China.
It is exciting to hear how the different branches of his empire strategically fit together and I really regret not taking more notes on this.</p><h2 id=highlights-from-2017>Highlights from 2017</h2><h3 id=hit-refresh>Hit Refresh</h3><p><code>by Satya Nadella</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/nadella.jpg class=left></p><p>A great book to learn about the <strong>cultural transformation at Microsoft</strong> that happened over the last ~10 years. Satya elaborates about how he pushes for diversity in various fields to come to the best possible decisions and products. This includes Microsofts push towards becoming more involved in Open Source as the amount of creativity and pure manpower in the Open Source world is huge - even when compared with a company like Microsoft.</p><h3 id=weapons-of-math-destruction>Weapons of Math Destruction</h3><p><code>by Cathy O'Neil</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/math.jpg class=right></p><p>This book takes a look at the <strong>risks of AI</strong>. Not in the Terminator Doomsday kind but the very real risks we already have to consider - but often ignore - today. The main point made in the book is that people too often think <em>results given by machines are objective</em> and do not realize they too are subject to prejudice and bias. It is very important to clearly <strong>differentiate</strong> at this point. The machine itself is objective in what it does, but the person operating the machine is not. Therefore it is important to pay close attention to how AI results were achieved.</p><ol><li>What was the training set?</li><li>Was the validation set large and independent enough?</li><li>Are we aware of existing biases in the training data that might influence the result, e.g. demographic of a region</li><li>Is the score function vulnerable to biases?</li></ol><p>The book does not ask to ablish AI but to be more aware of the results and to trust <strong>facts over data</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-phoenix-project>The Phoenix Project</h3><p><code>by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr &amp; George Spafford</code> <img src=/assets/book-2018/phoenix.jpg class=left></p><p>A <strong>must read</strong> for everyone involved in IT and uses buzzwords like <strong>DevOps</strong> - especially managers. This novel is easy to read and follows the journey of a <em>classic</em> IT manager into the world of DevOps. Several chapters explain how changes in manufactoring (e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban>Kanban</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen>Kaizen</a>) are comparable to the DevOps movement in IT and thereby also help traditional manufacturing managers to better understand the world of IT. I do not want to write another post about the impact of DevOps but if you are interested in <strong>digital transformation</strong> I can highly recommend this great book.</p><p>The most notable quote might be <em>The Three Ways</em> that keep getting repeated when it comes to managing IT projects:</p><blockquote><ol><li>The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations, because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs between the business and the customer.</li><li>The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework.</li><li>The Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.</li></ol></blockquote><p>An explanation of the ways can be found in this <a href=https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/>blog post by the Author Gene Kim</a>.</p><h2 id=upcoming>Upcoming</h2><p>I will publish posts on the following books I also read in 2018 soon:</p><ul><li><strong>Powerful</strong> talking about things I take from Netflix&rsquo; culture that are easy to apply</li><li><strong>How Google works</strong> focusing on how to hire and build a great team <em>Update: 2019-01-31 <a href=/book/2019-01-31-book-google-schmidt>published</a></em></li></ul><p>It was great to think back to all those books and I hope it will be as fun for future books. Please let me know what you think about the books or any recommendations you have for me in the comments or on <a href=https://twitter.com/anoff_io>Twitter</a>.</p></div><div class=footer><div class=tags><i class="fa fa-tags"></i><div class=links><a href=/tags/books>books</a></div></div></div></article></div><div class=paginator></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=right><div class=external-profiles><strong>Social media</strong>
