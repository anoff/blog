# Intro

For the last ~15 months I spent a lot of wasted time (commuting to work, waiting at the doctors, sitting on planes) with audio books. I have never been a big reader and the entry barrier to start listening to a book instead of music is a lot lower than packing books, reading instead of listening etc. That's why I became a really big fan of listening to various audiobooks.

Years ago I listened to a lot of books by [Andreas Eschbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach) which I still love for their amazing worlds that are somewhat SciFi but also very realistic. They do not build an entire new civilization with new kinds of lifeforms, instead they alter one tiny detail e.g. humans mastered nano robots or growing oil from bacteria. My all time favorite is [Lord of all things [not a referral]](https://www.amazon.de/Lord-All-Things-Andreas-Eschbach/dp/1477849815).

# Motivation

Over the last months I mainly listened to audiobooks for learning instead of entertainment. I focus on the following areas:

- team culture
- leadership in tech
- entrepreneurship / innovation
- biographies of interesting (IT) people
- impact of tech on ethics and social norms

As most people do, after getting new ideas from many books I like to talk with friends and colleagues what I would like to change in my life according to the things I just learned. In this blog series I want to share these ideas with you.
My goal is not to provide a book review per-se but to share the things that are the **major learnings** for me personally.

# My books in 2018

I will kick off this series with an overview of the books I went through in 2018 and late 2017.
Since I did not keep notes on all the books some might only have very short opinion on it.

## Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future

> by Ashlee Vance

After the hype around SpaceX Falcon launch I wanted to learn more about [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) - especially his past and how he got to the point where he runs several big firms with an incredible impact on humanity. This **biography** does a good job at this and also claims to be the only one that actually got Musk to give info/feedback about his biography.

The book starts off with Musks youth in South Africa and eventually tells the story of his first enterpreneurial steps with zip ðŸš¨ something that could have been google maps and his online payment startup that - by selling it - allowed him to start Tesla Inc.

There is a great blog post out there ðŸš¨ waitbutwhy/neurallink trying to give an explanation on Elon Musks overall strategy when it comes to his various companies. It gives far better food for thought than the biography I read - altough the bio is great to get more insights on his early years.

## Alibaba: The house that Jack Ma built

> by Duncan Clark

After learning about the CEO of Tesla and Microsoft I decided to take a peek at the other side of the globe and binged the **biography** of Alibabas CEO Jack Ma.
Before listening to this book I thought I was somewhat aware of the size of the Ali empire; but I was wrong. This book starts off by detailing Alibabas birth and how Jack Ma never sought to compete with Amazon or eBay (B2C) but instead focus on the B2B market to offer a marketplace to the diverse and growing manufacturing industry in China.
It is exciting to hear how the different branches of his empire strategically fit together and I really regret not taking more notes on this.

## Rework

> ðŸš¨ by ... DHH

- enterpreneurial tips for small business with quick time to market e.g. online services
- keep your producut simple -> allows easy onboarding with a streamlined experience, keeps diversity of opinions low -> focus on growth instead of upselling more complex featuers that would drive diversity into the customer group
- keep track of feature requests and only consider the top n% recurring requests - depending on how much you are able to innovate
- having a product with well known limitations keeps customers from being disappointed by realizing later on that things are not supported


# Previous highlights

> ðŸš¨ by Satya Nadella



## Weapons of Math Destruction

> ðŸš¨

- machine learning is not discriminatory

- beware of bias in data
- never take AI results out of context (score function, training data)
- do not believe that AI results are objective because they always include the man-made biases within the training sets

## The Phoenix Project

> ðŸš¨

- must read for devops

- how to relate IT to classic hardware business
- fairytale of digital transformation

# Upcoming

I will publish two books I already heard in this series before continuing on with new ones:

- **Powerful** talking about things I take from Netflix' culture that are easy to apply
- **How Google works** focusing on how to hire and build a great team


## Clean Architecture

This is a book that should be read and not listened to ðŸ™ƒ

- tension between isolation and separation
- weekly build vs continous integration
