# Intro

For the last ~15 months I spent a lot of wasted time (commuting to work, waiting at the doctors, sitting on planes) with audio books. I have never been a big reader and the entry barrier to start listening to a book instead of music is a lot lower than packing books, reading instead of listening etc. That's why I became a really big fan of listening to various audiobooks.



- motivation for books
- criteria for selection..
- Audiobooks
- friend asked for recommendations..


# Motivation


## How Google Works

> by ex-CEO Eric Schmidt and former SVP of Products Jonathan

- hire people that want to learn over people that have learned (generalists over experts in IT because IT is changing fast)
- hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team -> no diverse opinions (LAX rule)
- hiring is every employees reponsibility - make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for EVERYone, get people that are interesting not explicitly likable
- if you start not hiring the best and settle for good you end up with bad after a few cycles
- bad point: creative people want open office spaces? WTF
- very exaggerated view on _classic_ companies
- snippets: weekly _diaries_ max 1 page by every person published into the intranet w/o further presentation

## Musk bioX

- interesting to learn about his early years
- _only_ bio with actual POI involvement?

## Clean Architecture

## Alibaba: The house that Jack Ma built

> by Duncan Clark

## Powerful: Building a culture of freedom and responsibility

> by Patty McCord

- don't turn you company into a people that people want to work in but make it something that makes other people admire in a C
- feedback, see oneCS

### Andreas Eschbach..

### The Phoenix Project

- amazing storytelling, packing management lessons into a novel
- how to relate IT to classic hardware business
- fairytale of digital transformation
