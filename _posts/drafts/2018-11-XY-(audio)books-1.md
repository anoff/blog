- hire people that want to learn over people that have learned (generalists over experts in IT because IT is changing fast)
- hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team -> no diverse opinions (LAX rule)
- hiring is every employees reponsibility - make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for EVERYone, get people that are interesting not explicitly likable
