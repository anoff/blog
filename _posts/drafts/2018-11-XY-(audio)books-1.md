# Intro

For the last ~15 months I spent a lot of wasted time (commuting to work, waiting at the doctors, sitting on planes) with audio books. I have never been a big reader and the entry barrier to start listening to a book instead of music is a lot lower than packing books, reading instead of listening etc. That's why I became a really big fan of listening to various audiobooks.

Years ago I listened to a lot of books by [Andreas Eschbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach) which I still love for their amazing worlds that are somewhat SciFi but are very realistic. They do not build an entire new civilization with new kinds of lifeforms, instead they alter one tiny detail e.g. humans mastered nano robots or growing oil from bacteria. My all time favorite must be [Lord of all things [not a referral]](https://www.amazon.de/Lord-All-Things-Andreas-Eschbach/dp/1477849815).

# Motivation

Over the last months I mainly listened to audiobooks for information instead of entertainment. I mostly focus on the following areas:

- team culture
- leadership in tech
- entrepreneurship / innovation
- biographies of interesting (IT) people
- impact of tech on ethics and social norms

As most people do, after getting new ideas from many books I like to talk with friends and colleagues what I would like to change in my life according to the things I just learned. In this blog series I want to share these ideas with you.
It may also act as detailed (but biased) reviews to various books you might be interested in. My goal is not to provide a book review per-se but to interpret the things that are the biggest learnings for me personally.

# My books in 2018

Because I did not keep notes on all the books some might only have very short opinion on it.

## Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping our Future

> by Ashlee Vance

After the hype around SpaceX Falcon launch I wanted to learn more about [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) - especially his past and how he got to the point where he runs several big firms with an incredible impact on humanity. The book does a good job at this and also claims to be the only one that actually got Musk to give info/feedback about his biography.

## Alibaba: The house that Jack Ma built

> by Duncan Clark


## Clean Architecture



## Rework

## Previous ones years

### Hit Refresh

### Weapons of Math Destruction

- beware of bias in data
- never take AI results out of context (score function, training data)
- do not believe that AI results are objective because they always include the man-made biases within the training sets

### Andreas Eschbach..

### The Phoenix Project

- must read for devops
- amazing storytelling, packing management lessons into a novel
- how to relate IT to classic hardware business
- fairytale of digital transformation

# Upcoming

I will publish two books I already heard in this series before continuing on with new ones:

- **Powerful** talking about things I take from Netflix' culture that are easy to apply
- **How Google works** focusing on how to hire and build a great team



## Powerful: Building a culture of freedom and responsibility

> by Patty McCord

- don't turn you company into a people that people want to work in but make it something that makes other people admire in a C
- feedback, see oneCS


## How Google Works

> by ex-CEO Eric Schmidt and former SVP of Products Jonathan

- hire people that want to learn over people that have learned (generalists over experts in IT because IT is changing fast)
- hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team -> no diverse opinions (LAX rule)
- hiring is every employees reponsibility - make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for EVERYone, get people that are interesting not explicitly likable
- if you start not hiring the best and settle for good you end up with bad after a few cycles
- bad point: creative people want open office spaces? WTF
- very exaggerated view on _classic_ companies
- snippets: weekly _diaries_ max 1 page by every person published into the intranet w/o further presentation
