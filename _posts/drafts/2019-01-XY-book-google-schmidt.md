# Intro

> by ex-CEO Eric Schmidt and former SVP of Products Jonathan

- hire people that want to learn over people that have learned (generalists over experts in IT because IT is changing fast)
- hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team -> no diverse opinions, instead hiring people that you can have objective arguments with (LAX rule)
- hiring is every employees reponsibility - make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for EVERYone, get people that are interesting not explicitly likable
- if you start not hiring the best and settle for good you end up with bad after a few cycles
- bad point: creative people want open office spaces? WTF
- very exaggerated view on _classic_ companies
- snippets: weekly _diaries_ max 1 page by every person published into the intranet w/o further presentation
