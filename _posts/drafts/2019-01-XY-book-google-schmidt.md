## Recruiting

- hire people that want to learn over people that have learned (generalists over experts in IT because IT is changing fast)
- smart creatives
- hiring (only) people you want to have as friends makes a bad team -> no diverse opinions, instead hiring people that you can have objective arguments with (LAX rule)
- hiring is every employees reponsibility - make it part of your yearly employee reviews and bonuses for EVERYone, get people that are interesting not explicitly likable
- if you start not hiring the best and settle for good you end up with bad after a few cycles
- bad point: creative people want open office spaces? WTF
- very exaggerated view on _classic_ companies

-> check CV for willingness to learn  

## Innovation

- giving customers what they want is not innovative
- instead surprise them and provide something fundamentally useful
- multiple small non-innovative steps combined can lead to innovative products, e.g. grouping/AI in mail
- innovators do not need to be told that they should be innovative, innovation is not learned it is a personality trait
- give innovators freedom to actually get innovation
- large corporations attract risk-avoiding employees that often tend not to be innovative

## Management

A lot of talk about management but my main takeaways;

if innovative:

- if everything is under control you're not going fast enough (race quote)
- processes are slower than reality
- chaos is the normal not an exception
- order and processes can not be enforced but only be achieved by joint effort of everyone involved (management to worker), requires openenss, transparency, meritocracy, honesty

## competence management

- dynamic self, get feedback and evolve
- always keep learning, enable your employees to learn, select those that want to learn
- someone willing to learn is more valuable than a specialist
  - generalist > specialist, specialist may always be biased in decision making
  - IT changes fast -> noone is a specialist for long -> keep learning
- snippets: weekly _diaries_ max 1 page by every person published into the intranet w/o further presentation
