Over the last year I played around with the techradar approach for various situations in my professional life where I felt the need for new ways to deal with technical skills.
In this post I will present these different applications where techradars can help you.

:toc:

== Thoughtworks techradar

== Managing technology in a project or organization

Thoughtworks publishes its techradar to share knowledge about emerging technology and its adoption in the software world.
This often results in multiple competing technologies being presented in their publication.
By changing the scope you can use the techradar method to create a competence fingerprint of a project.
For this you just use the classic techradar configuration but only look at technologies you want to use in your project.


== Personal competence management

The classic techradar consists of four quadrants (tools, frameworks & languages, platforms and techniques) and four levels of maturity (hold, assess, trial and adopt).
By changing the maturity level to a skill oriented scale the techradar method can be used to keep track of personal competences and skills.
One possible scale to measure skill is the US NIH proficiency scale with the levels novice, intermetdiate, advanced and expert.
For software developers trying to keep track of tech skills the classic quadrants should be a good fit; for other job environments or a wider range of competences you may want to modify the quadrant definition as well.

== Identifying synergies at scale

By comparing multiple project-level techradars you can identify which technologies and techniques they have in common.
All too often synergies depend on the implementation details and not on the things you see in polished powerpoint slides.
Sadly most synergies are _identified_ based on those powerpoint slides.
Comparing the technological fingerprint of a project works across projects, organizations and functional domains.
Teams with a similar fingerprint can leverage use synergies in their day to day life by sharing experiences, joint training sessions and even employee rotation.

== Guide innovation

Project level techradars can be used to establish a process of updating a teams technology stack.
Instead of hype-driven development where new frameworks are brought from Twitter straight into production within a few sprints the techradar allows you to do this in a controlled way.
With introducing a new tool and moving it into the _assess_ level you define how you want to assess in particular: is there an upcoming feature this tool should be used for; do you want to start a separate proof of concept.
It does not really matter what you do - however it is important to define what you want to do and what how you measure the success of this assessment.
After a successful assessment you can start rolling out the tool and move it into the _trial_ level and finally make it the de-facto standard (_adopt_).

== Competence management for teams

Combining a project level techradar and personal techradars for each developer allows you to get an overview of existing and missing competences in your team.
For team leads it is a great way to plan competence development for their team members.
In case of turnover within the team it is also very easy to identify the gaps that might be opening up by a person leaving the team.
