link:https://gitea.io/en-us/[Gitea] is an open source git hosting platform, written in Go forked from the Gogs project and seems to be highly inspired by GitHub.
If you want to host your own git platform and want to use **Azure Active Directory** as an authentication provider - this post might help you.

Used abbreviations:

- AP: Authentication Provider
- AD: Active Directory
- AAD: Azure Active Directory

== Authentication Providers

Instead of managing credentials in your application you can use external authentication providers (AP) to deal with user authentication.
The most common scenario nowadays is the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth[OAUTH] protocol.
Using an AP not only makes your life as a service developer/admin easier but also the user because he can reuse his identity from other services.

Gitea supports several authentication types and when it comes to OAUTH also several providers. The one we will use for including **Azure Active Directory** is the link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] provider that actually exposes a common standard for authentication providers to use, so applications like Gitea do not have to implement individual OAUTH providers.

We will be using the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow[OAuth 2.0 auth code grant].

== Creating an Azure AD application

NOTE: This guide uses the _App registrations Preview_, if you use the classic app registrations you can just create a `native` application.

The first step is to create an application on Azure, head over to link:https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredAppsPreview[AAD - App Registrations] in the portal and register a new application:

- **name**: irrelevant for the setup, will be presented to the user when asking for his permissions
- **type**: web
- **redirect URI**: `<host>/user/oauth2/<Authentication Name>/callback` as a callback URL where `<Authentication Name>` is a value you will specify in the next chapter e.g. _AAD_, _Azure Auth_

For Azure to implement the correct authorization flow (`code`) we need to change our **application type** to `native`, this can be done via the _Manage -> Authentication_ blade in the Azure Portal. Set The default application type to `Yes`. In case the UI changes make sure to look out for _Device code flow_ and make sure it is configured to use this method.

Scroll up on the same page and make sure you have a Redirect URI of type `Web` set correctly.

Finally we need to create a **Client secret** by going to the _Manage -> Certificates & secrets_ panel and add a new client secret.

CAUTION: Make sure to copy the secret as it is created - you will not be able to access it later.

For the configuration in Gitea you need the following values from your Azure App registration:

. **Client Secret**
. **Client ID**: go to the application _Overview_ and copy the Application (client) ID string
. **OpenID URL**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration` where you can find your tenant also in the _Overview_ tab as Directory (tenant) ID

== Add Authentication Source in Gitea

On the Gitea administration page select _Authentication Sources_ and create a new one:

- **Authentication Type**: OAuth2
- **Authentication Name**: the same name you used for defining the callback URL in the previous step (e.g. _AAD_, _Azure AD_)
- **OAuth2 Provider**: OpenID Connect
- **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **OpenID Connect URL** as previously specified
