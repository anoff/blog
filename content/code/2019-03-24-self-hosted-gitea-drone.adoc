This post will walk you through setting up a self hosted git based continuous integration environment on a two machine setup - assuming you already have two virtual machines at your disposal.
Using link:{gitea-url}[**Gitea**] for git hosting and contribution management and link:{drone-url}[**Drone**] for docker-based build jobs, this will guide you through creating **docker-compose** files as well as configuring the individual services and getting **SSL certificates** via link:{traefik-url}[**traefik**].
Docker and docker-compose knowledge is required for this tutorial. It mostly focuses on the correct configuration of all the services at play here and not explaining their basic functionality.

This tutorial uses Azure resources so some of the aspects might not be 100% applicable if you chose another infrastructure provider.

== Prerequisites

For this to work you need two virtual machines (commands for Ubuntu) and a PostgreSQL database.
I used the following Azure services for this setup:

- Azure PostgreSQL Server
  - Postgres v10.0
  - 70 GB storage
  - 1 vCores
  - attached data disk (managed disk)
- 2x VM Ubuntu
  - Standard A2 v2 (2 vCPUs, 4 GB memory)

.Required infrastructure setup
image::vm-setup.svg[Infrastructure setup]

The post will keep referring to _the gitea vm_ or _the drone machine_, it might be useful to add DNS records to easily identify which machine you are looking at.

== Prepare PostgreSQL

This is suggested if you want to have a shared PostgreSQL server with other applications accessing it too.
Administration is easiest via https://shell.azure.com[Azure Cloud shell] after activating _Allow access to Azure services_ in the _Connection Security_ pane of the Postgres server.
The Azure Shell already has the `psql` and other CLIs installed by default.

[source,bash]
----
psql --host=mydb.postgres.database.azure.com --port=5432 --username=machina@mydb --dbname=postgres
# interactive password login
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
CREATE ROLE gitea with LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'supersexypassword';
CREATE DATABASE gitea;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE gitea to gitea;
----

== Configure the Virtual Machines

For each virtual machine do the following steps

. Install Docker & docker-compose
. Format & auto mount data disk
. Create a Docker user
. Change SSH port to 2022

=== Install Docker & docker-compose

[source,bash]
----
# Docker
#   https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg-agent \
  software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Compose
#   https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

=== Mount data disk

NOTE: This step is only necessary if you want to use external data disks like I do and do not have them mounted already.

`lsblk`: Find available disks and check for the device mountpoint of your data disk

The following script will format the device as `ext4` and mount it under `/data`. If you prefer your data to reside anywhere else keep in mind that this tutorial uses `/data` later on again.

[source,bash]
----
sudo -s # enter root mode
DATA_DISK=/dev/sdc # CHANGE TO YOUR <MOUNTPOINT>
# Mount data disk, xfs will not encrypt on Azure
mkfs.ext4 ${DATA_DISK}

# identify UUID: blkid -s UUID
DATA_DISK_UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value ${DATA_DISK})
mkdir /data
# Add line to /etc/fstab
echo "UUID=${DATA_DISK_UUID} /data auto defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount -a
exit
----

For more information refer to the [Azure help](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/attach-disk-portal).

=== Create a Docker user

To isolate the docker process create a separate unix user that belongs to the docker group and owns the data directory.
This user will later be used to run the docker containers.

```sh
sudo -s
DOCKER_USER=minion
mkdir /data/home
mkdir /data/volumes
useradd -d /data/home ${DOCKER_USER}
chown ${DOCKER_USER}: /data/home -R
chown ${DOCKER_USER}: /data/volumes/ -R
# give docker access by adding it to the group
gpasswd -a ${DOCKER_USER} docker
exit
# find user ID
id ${DOCKER_USER}
```

NOTE: For the Gitea setup we will later need this users ID.

=== Change SSH port

Changing the SSH port only reduces the attack vector but does not make your system any more secure.
It is still a practice I follow for all my systems because it is minimal effort and makes it harder for port scanners to find the machine.
In the case of the Gitea server this is also recommended as it easily allows you to bind the SSH port for git access.

[source,bash]
----
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# uncomment and change L3: Port 2222
----

== Reverse Proxy setup

Even though Gitea and Drone come with integrated https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] support to generate SSL certificates I chose another path.
For one reason I could not get them working properly and adding a dedicated reverse proxy to handle SSL and routing makes any migrations or changes to the setup easier.

In this setup https://traefik.io/[traefik] is used as a low profile router.
The picture below shows an example setup how traefik can be used within docker to make two different services A and service B accessible from the outside, both via HTTP on port 80 as well as auto generated SSL certificates on HTTPS 443.
Traefik by default forwards HTTP requests to HTTPS which should be what you want.
By configuring traefik within the docker-compose you can expose both services under different DNS names with a single public IP address.

NOTE: If you do not wish to use a reverse proxy then simply do not follow the traefik specific configuration.

== Setting up Gitea

Connect to the gitea VM, switch to the user that was previously created using `sudo su - minion` and create the `docker-compose.yml`.
Even though it is possible to configure Gitea to some extend using docker-compose I suggest only using minimal definitions in the compose file itself and then modify the `app.ini` after an initial start.
There are certain settings that are only possible in the ini file itself.

=== Compose file

.docker-compose.yml
[source, yaml]
----

----
<1> add the ID of the user that was created previously for running the docker commands
<2> replace with your own PostgreSQL credentials
<3> Gitea needs to know its domain to generate correct links, Traefik needs to know it to generate correct SSL certs and route correctly

=== Traefik configuration

Before starting the containers add the traefik configuration files under `/data/volumes/traefik/`

.traefik.toml
[source, toml]
----
#Traefik Global Configuration
debug = false
checkNewVersion = true
logLevel = "ERROR"

#Define the EntryPoint for HTTP and HTTPS
defaultEntryPoints = ["https","http"]
[entryPoints]
[entryPoints.http]
address = ":80"
[entryPoints.https]
address = ":443"
#Enable automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS
[entryPoints.http.redirect]
entryPoint = "https"
[entryPoints.https.tls]

#Enable Traefik Dashboard on port 8080
#with basic authentication method
[entryPoints.dash]

See the https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/ubuntu-docker-traefik-proxy/#step-install-and-configure-traefik-reverse-proxy[howtoforge.com/ubuntu-docker-traefik-proxy] blog post for more details.

The `acme.json` file just needs before starting docker.

[source, bash]
----
touch /data/volumes/traefik/acme.json
chmod 600 touch /data/volumes/traefik/acme.json
----

=== Starting the Gitea container

Finally start the services on the gitea VM from the home directory

[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME
docker-compose up -d
----

This is the setup we just rolled out on the Gitea VM.

.Gitea docker setup
image::vm-gitea.svg[Docker images for Gitea VM]

=== Customize Gitea

After the initial start of the Gitea container, stop it again `docker-compose stop` and modify the configuration as needed. Refer to the https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet[Gitea Config Cheatsheet] for a full list of available settings.

[source, bash]
----
nano /data/volumes/gitea/gitea/config/app.ini
----

== Setting up Drone

The drone VM will also use traefik as a reverse proxy and SSL provider, refer to the Gitea setup for the generic traefik steps.
SSH into the _Drone VM_ and change to the minion user.

=== Drone compose file

Place the following file into the home directory:

.docker-compose.yml

=== Starting the Gitea container

CAUTION: Make sure traefik is correctly configured on this VM as well

Start the docker containers from the home directory

[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME
docker-compose up -d
----

The final setup for Drone looks like this

== Summary

Gitea and Drone are running on individual machines but are fully configured to talk to each other.
This separation beyond the container level guarantees that the performance of the git server will not be influenced by any builds running in the CI/CD pipeline.
If that is not a concern the both services could also be set up on a single virtual machine with either one or two docker-compose files.
