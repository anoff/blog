I just migrated the link:https://github.com/anoff/devradar/tree/master/editor[code] for the link://editor.devradar.io[devradar editor] to the latest major version of vuetify.
There is an officiel link:https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/releases-and-migrations[migration guide] that helped me solve 70% of the issues but here is a quick overview of the biggest issues I encountered and what actually changed.

> ðŸš¨ This was written for a migration from `vuetify 1.5.14` to `vuetify 2.1.1`
  Also all code samples are typescript, but should also work for Javascript projects

== Bootstrapping

Looking at the new link:https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start#quick-start[Quick start section] of vuetify 2.x you will notice that the way vuetify is added to Vue.js has changed.
Previously vuetify was just included via `Vue.use()` now it also needs to be instantiated.

.main.ts (vuetify 1.5)
[source, typescript]
....
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import '~vuetify/src/stylus/main' <1>
import Vuetify from 'vuetify' <1>

Vue.use(Vuetify, { <1>
  theme: appConfig.theme
})

/* eslint-disable no-new */
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  components: { App },
  render: h => h(App),
  template: '<App/>'
})
....
<1> These modifications should be removed when migrating

The new setup would look like this

.main.ts (vuetify 2)
[source, typescript]
....
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify/lib' <1>
import App from './App.vue'
import 'vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css' <2>

Vue.use(Vuetify) <3>

const vuetifyOpts = { <4>
  theme: appConfig.theme
}

/* eslint-disable no-new */
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  router,
  store,
  components: { App },
  render: h => h(App),
  template: '<App/>',
  vuetify: new Vuetify(vuetifyOpts) <4>
})
....
<1> Load vuetify
<2> include the `css` instead of stylus sheet
<3> Register vuetify with Vue.js
<4> Configure and instantiate vuetify in the new vue instance

== Loading styles

This was already implicitly shown in the previous section but might be worth another mention.

Whereas previously the vuetify styles were provided via a `styl(us)` file they are now precompiled `css`.

[source, typescript]
....
// vuetify 1.5
import 'vuetify/src/stylus/main.styl'

// vuetify 2.x
import 'vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css'
....

Also note that the npm module **sass** is required and **node-sass** no longer works.
You may need to swap by running

[source, bash]
....
npm uninstall node-sass
npm install --save-dev sass
....

== Adding vuetify types to typescript config

If you get a compile error from typescript stating that `Argument of type '{..}' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ComponentOptions<..>'` or `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'vuetify' does not exist in type` you need to register the vuetify types with typescript.
This was something I had not done before and may only be necessary with the change to vuetify 2.

.tsconfig.json
[source, javascript]
....
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
      "webpack-env",
      "node",
      "vuetify" <1>
    ]
  }
}
....
<1> add vuetify to the types property

== Theme options

If you are using a custom theme you might need to adapt to the new object structure that supports **light and dark mode** for your app.
It is mostly moving the color specification of the theme into another nested layer.

.vuetify 2 theme options structure
[plantuml]
....
!includeurl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anoff/d8f48105ac4d3c7b14ca8c34d6d54938/raw/7381f13a14e048bbd3cb4ecc70369e913908151a/anoff.plantuml
class theme {
  dark: boolean
  themes: Object
}

class themes {
  light: ColorSpec
  dark: ColorSpec
}

class ColorSpec {
  primary:\t colorcode as string
  secondary:\t colorcode as string
  accent:\t colorcode as string
  error:\t colorcode as string
  warning:\t colorcode as string
  info:\t\t colorcode as string
  success:\t colorcode as string
}

theme -- themes
themes -- ColorSpec
....

== Add MDI font

Vuetify now uses the material design icons for default icons like the hamburger navigation menu.
Install it as a dev dependency if you have not done so yet.
Alternatively you could configure Vuetify to use another icon font, see the official getting started docs for infos on that.

[source, bash]
....
npm install --save-dev @mdi/font
....

Then add it to your `main.ts`

[source, typescript]
....
import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css'
....

== Component changes

With the above changes your app should build correctly, however there will still be a lot of errors in the browser as many components have breaking changes.
Below are the main changes I had to fix in my link:https://devradar.io[devradar] link:https://editor.devradar.io[editor application].

=== Application Toolbar

There is a new component `v-app-bar` that should be used for application wide navigation toolbars.

[source, typescript]
....
// vuetify 1.5
<v-toolbar
    app dense scroll-off-screen
    color="accent"
    >

// vuetify 2
<v-app-bar
  scroll-off-screen
  dense
  color="accent"
  >
....

=== List view

All components in the list category have been renamed from `list-tile-xyz` to `list-item-xyz`.
Best just run a replace all operation and see if it broke anything ðŸ˜‰

== Done

These changes made my application compile and render the home app component without issues.
Various components changed and you may need to consult the migration docs for specific cases -- or just look at the new API docs directly as they are way more detailed.

If you stumbled upon this post, I hope it helped you. If it did not I would love to hear what you are missing in the comments or via link:https://twitter.com/anoff_io[Twitter DM] ðŸ‘‹
