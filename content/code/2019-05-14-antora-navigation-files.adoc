This third post in the series of Antora posts quickly addresses a feature I only recently discovered.
It will show you some techniques you can use to compose the navigation menu in a multi-repository, multi-module setup.
This is especially interesting if you have content spread across repositories that you want to present hierarchically in the navigation tree.

== Using multiple navigation files

Let us start with the basics: **How to combine navigation files?**

The link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/navigation/register-navigation-files/[Antora docs] explain how you can use multiple navigation files for one component by using the `nav` key in the component descriptor.
However this limits you to the operation of **concatenation**.

.Concatenating navigation files via component descriptor

To achieve such concatenation just define your component as

.antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
name: bp
title: Bird Person
version: HEAD
nav: 
- modules/ROOT/nav1.adoc
- modules/wedding/nav2.adoc
- modules/friends/nav3.adoc
----

== Composing navigation files by include

In case a plain concatenation does not do it and you want to compose your navigation structure across three different navigation files you can use the `include:` macro.
This can come in handy if you split content into multiple modules and want to include the content of the modules in varying order in the navigation menu.

.Inlining navigation content

In this scenario the component descriptor would reference a single navigation file

.antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
name: bp
title: Bird Person
version: HEAD
nav: 
- modules/ROOT/nav1.adoc
----

But the navigation file in turn references content from additional supplemental navigation files.

.modules/ROOT/nav1.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Bird Person
* xref:welcome.adoc[Welcome to Birdperson's life]
include::wedding:partial$nav2.adoc[
* xref:contact.adoc[Contact me]
include::friends:partial$nav3.adoc[]
----

.modules/wedding/nav2.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
* xref:wedding:invitation.adoc[Wedding Invitation]
** xref:wedding:attendees.adoc[Attendees]
----

.modules/friends/nav3.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
* Friends of Birdperson
** xref:friends:tammy.adoc[<3 Tammy]
** xref:friends:morty.adoc[Morty]
** xref:friends:rick.adoc[Rick]
----

.File structure for included nav files
image::antora-arc42/filetree-wedding.png[Screenshot of the file structure]

Given the above navigation files and directory structure you end up with the following navigation tree.
Notice how `nav2.adoc` is embedded in the content defined in `nav1.adoc`.

.Bird Person
* Welcome to Birdperson's life
* Wedding Invitation
** Attendees
* Contact me
* Friends of Birdperson
** <3 Tammy
** Morty
** Rick

IMPORTANT: For navigation files to be used by `include:` in Antora you need to place them inside a folder that is indexed by Antora. The suggested solution is storing it as a partial so it does not clutter the actual page space.

== Nesting navigation listings across files

There is another interesting scenario of including remote content.
Given our simple example this might seem far-fetched but consider the option of defining a high level list structure in `nav1.adoc` and filling certain branches of this navigation tree with included files.
In this scenario we want to include the list of Birdperson's friends but **continue the list indentation** from `nav1.adoc`.

.Nesting navigation content
image::antora-arc42/nav-nest.png[Nested navigation content]

By extending Birdpersons relationships also to enemies we want the following nav tree to be rendered:

.Bird Person
* Welcome to Birdperson's life
* Wedding Invitation
** Attendees
* Relationships
** Enemies
*** Galactic Federation
** Friends
*** <3 Tammy
*** Morty
*** Rick
* Contact me

For the sake of simplicity we will not add any pages for the _Enemies / Galactic Federation_ entries.
The changed files for this scenario are `nav1` and `nav3`.

.modules/ROOT/nav1.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Bird Person
* xref:welcome.adoc[Welcome to Birdperson's life]
include::wedding:partial$nav2.adoc[]
* Relationships
** Enemies
*** Galactic Federation
** Friends
+
--
include::friends:partial$nav3.adoc[]
--
+
* xref:contact.adoc[Contact me]
----

.modules/friends/nav3.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
** xref:friends:tammy.adoc[<3 Tammy]
** xref:friends:morty.adoc[Morty]
** xref:friends:rick.adoc[Rick]
----

Notice how `nav3.adoc` in this case only hosts the sub-elements and not the _Friends_ caption itself.
Using the same directory structure as previously the final rendered result in Antora looks like the nested list we expected to get.

.Nested navigation tree in Antora
image::antora-arc42/navtree-wedding.png[Nested navigation tree]

As expected the content of `nav2.adoc` is included on the same list level as `nav1.adoc`.
The list of friends from `nav3.adoc` however continues as a nested indentation within `ROOT/nav1.adoc`.
The picture below shows the included sections highlighted according to their respective navigation files.

== Closing words

Dan Allen posted a fantastic answer to my link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/issues/423#note_166845701[initial question] regarding this issue.
I encourage you to read it if you have questions about what happens exactly.

Another neat trick is to **reuse component definitions** if you are forced to spread documentation across different repositories that you actually want to show up in a common navigation tree.
This might be the case for multi-repository software projects where you want to create one generic software documentation and aggregate by content (e.g. all interfaces in one place).
To achieve this just use the same `antora.yml` file (same `name:` and `version:`) in multiple repositories.

You can view the example directories in link:https://github.com/anoff/blog/tree/master/static/assets/antora-arc42/[github.com/anoff/blog] and run the `playbook-nest.yml`.
