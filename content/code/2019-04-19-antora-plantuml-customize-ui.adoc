This post will cover some slightly advanced steps for building a multi-repository Asciidoc documentation using link://antora.org/[Antora].
My previous post link://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-15-antora-first-steps/[blog.anoff.io/2019-02-15-antora-first-steps] covered basics of Antora and how to migrate existing AsciiDoc files.
In this post I will go through the steps of including content from another repository, building a custom UI and adding plantUML support to the (automated, dockerized) build.

== plantUML support

One of the most important things for me when it comes to software docs is the ability to show relationships and interactions using diagrams.
As you might know from my link:/2018-07-31-diagrams-with-plantuml/[previous posts] I am a huge plantUML fan.
So plantUML support is important both for rendering the Antora website and the local development.

== Local preview

For local previews I use the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc extension] by JoÃ£o Pinto.

.PlantUML preview in VS code
image::/assets/antora-puml/vscode-asciidoc.png[VS Code Preview of PlantUML in .aodc]

To get the plugin working you need to set the `plantuml-server-url` Asciidoctor attribute on your page as described on the link:https://github.com/eshepelyuk/asciidoctor-plantuml.js#configuration[asciidoctor-plantuml package] that is used for rendering in VSC.
Sadly this needs to be set for every single adoc file - if you want to preview it.

== Antora plantUML rendering

To enable plantUML in Antora you need to register the link:https://github.com/eshepelyuk/asciidoctor-plantuml.js#configuration[asciidoctor-plantuml package] and configure the same attribute as for local preview.
However in the case of Antora you an specify it one in the `playbook.yml`.

NOTE: If you have a different server defined in the page itself, this will overrule the global config.

== Multiple repositories for a single documentation

Another feature I promised to address during my link:/2019-02-15-antora-first-steps/[previous post] was splitting up content into multiple Antora modules/components.
For my link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42[arc42 dummy project] I used both.

.Table of Contents for ARC42 project
image::/assets/antora-puml/arc-toc.png[ARC42 table of contents]

Given the above table of contents the chapters _Cross-cutting concepts_ and _Architecture decisions_ where put into a separate module within the main component.
The modules _concepts_ and _adr_ (architecture design record) are moved into link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42/tree/master/docs/modules[separate modules] because I prefer to have each concept/adr in a separate `.adoc` file.
For this example a simple subfolder within the `ROOT/pages` directory might suffice but in a real world scenario having a different module might come in handy to handle these important topics more efficiently.
Both concepts and ADRs are aggregated into a single `index.adoc` file in each module and are included in the main build.

A separate Antora component is used in this example for the _Media Manager_ subsystem that makes up one of the level 1 building blocks.
Imagine this subsystem being developed in a separate repository.
In this case you want to keep the respective documentation within the _MediaManager_ repository.
This is done in the link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42-mediaman[antora-arc42-mediaman] repository where all the subsystems source code and documentation shall be kept.

In the example build the Level 2 definition of the _Media Manager_ block diagram view is included from the remote repository of the subsystem.
You can see this include on link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42/blame/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/05_building_block_view.adoc#L178[line 178 of the building_block_view.adoc].

So overall the ARC42 build uses four modules spread across two components to build its entire documentation.
Some modules provide link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/asciidoc/include-partial/[Antora partials] whereas others provide entire pages that get referenced in the main ROOT module.

}

== Customizing the Antora UI

For minor modifications of the UI you can use the _supplemental_files_ attribute in the playbook.
Supplemental files allow you to exchange parts of the **built** UI bundle.
Given the current state of the default UI that you can find at link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable[gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default] this is best used to modify the content of header, footer etc.

=== Applying minor changes via supplement_files

On link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42/tree/34fb829cd4924d6fcc937e9cb72bdaeac73b8cf1/supplemental-ui[this commit] of the antora-arc42 you can see _supplementa_files_ being defined and used.
To modify content from the UI bundle simply check it into the repository of your antora playbook and reference it

.Specifying supplemental_files for the Antora UI bundle
[source, yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui
----

In the repository I applied a custom footer template to the bundle.

.supplemental-ui/partials/footer-content.hbs
[source, html]
----
<footer class="footer">
  <p>Original arc42 template licensed under <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arc42/arc42-template/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT</a> and modified for antora fit by <a href="https://anoff.io">Andreas Offenhaeuser</a>, the page is created using the Antora Default UI licensed under <a href="https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/blob/master/LICENSE">MPL-2.0</a></p>
</footer>
----

As all style attributes are bundled into a single `site.css` file it is quite hard to modify the UI style via this method.
Dan - the author of Antora - explained it like this in an link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/issues/149[issue discussion] I had in the Antora repository.

.Dan Allen on customizing the UI
image::/assets/antora-puml/ui-style.png[Dan Allen on customizing the UI]

=== Creating a custom UI bundle

Not being able to modify the generated sites style via the _supplemental_files_ method I set out to create a custom UI bundle for my ARC42 documentation.
The main changes I implemented with this bundle are:

. custom color theme via link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42-ui/commit/a678116e661bc1d1e06bf72559ff21a886a260dd[src/css/]
. customized header and footer files
. add a link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42-ui/commit/11fc95f7946046e203d6cf093715a3c37c35b6ce[custom CSS/JS] to provide help text that can be toggled via the `toggle help` text in the navigation bar
. remove the component navigation dropdown as shown in the image below

.Antora component navigator
image::/assets/antora-puml/navdrop.gif[component navigation dropdown]

The component navigation has been removed because in the case of the ARC42 documentation the MediaManager component is not a documentation in itself but merely a way of creating a _multi-repository architecture documentation_.
Therefore only a single entrypoint into the documentation is required.
If your project has both - Antora components that merely serve as partial/page providers and components that serve as standalone documentation you may want to create a custom navigation option as well.

== Summary

The Antora ARC42 build now consists of three repositories

. the playbook and main ARC42 dos at https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42
. an Antora component to provide lower level documentation of the link:https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42-mediaman[antora-arc42-mediaman] to be included in the build
. a custom UI bundle https://github.com/anoff/antora-arc42-ui

These repositories should act as a good reference to create more advanced builds with Antora while not cluttering the individual repositories with too many features/changes.
As with most of my recent projects all automation is done via link:https://cloud.drone.io/anoff/antora-arc42[Drone CI], see the respective `.drone.yml` repositories in the main repository and the UI bundle for reference.

You can view the final result at link:http://gitarc.xyz/system/0.9.0/03_system_scope_and_context.html?help[gitarc.xyz] with `?help` showing all the original ARC42 help texts for each chapter.
