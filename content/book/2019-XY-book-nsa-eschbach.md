> by Andreas Eschbach

- Computer, mobile phones and internet (world net) invented before 1930
- story plays in the Nazi era
- all available data is stored at the national security agency (NSA)
- using big data to detect nazi opposition
- programming is done by women only ("program weaving")
- cash money has been discontinued, only payments with card or mobile phone
    - NSA knows who bought what and when
    - knowing what food people buy allows to identify households that likely hide additional people
    - this leads to one scene where a girl named Anne Frank is captured in Amsterdam due to anomaly in calorie consumption
- high degree of automation in war factories leads to covert cyber warfare
- Nazi scientists start simulating the brain using computers -> neural netorks that detect all sorts of anomalities in peoples behavior

List of snafus
- tracking peoples phone over time to identify groups of people meeting regularly -> likely forming an underground resistance, check phone records and conversations (eavesdropping on TVs and all mobile phones possible)
- all sales per person on record
    - list of all food items and their properties (calories) on record
    - calculate calorie intake per household/person -> search homes with above average values
    - floor plans on record -> check for hidden rooms
- most of these things only work because the citizens do not know about the technological capabilities
