- don't turn you company into a brand that people want to work in instead make it a place people are proud of/admired for to have in their CV
- feedback, see oneCS
- agile business comes from empowered teams -> reporting and approval processes slow down *every* decision
- seeing the impact of ones work is (one of) the biggest motivators
- facts are more important than data (link to WOMD), knowing that something happens does not help you find a solution - facts help you to understand why things are happening and get the context
- to identify how to train members imagine the tasks that will come up in 6 months and how your team can work on them - find potential for growth
- also identify people that can no longer contribute to your companies success (e.g. their technological expertise is not required because of a cancelled product)
    - let them go
    - might be tough in germany
- good feedback addresses behavior not character
    - giving: learn to criticize actions not people
    - receiving: see feedback as a free lesson in how to become a better you
