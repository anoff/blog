While setup and migration to Hugo was a breeze, I spent a lot of time making my .adoc formatted post work with the new blog. After working through several GitHub issues I ended up manipulating the DOM with Javascript to get admonitions working. It still doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right - but hey it works! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This post will cover the steps I took in case I myself or anyone out there ever needs to do this again.</description></item><item><title>RBAC with Google Firestore</title><link>//blog.anoff.io/2018-08-12-rbac-firestore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//blog.anoff.io/2018-08-12-rbac-firestore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post will explain how to implement role based access control (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control&#34;&gt;RBAC&lt;/a&gt;) using the Google Firestore serverless database. Firebase and Firestore in particular with the concept presented in this post offers the most seamless integration of serverless infrastructure with a mobile client at this point.

Which web framework, which style library, which server framework - and more importantly how does it all work together?
In this post we will put together a bunch of great tools out there to build a realtime web app with a few single lines of code.</description></item><item><title>Automated dev workflow for using Data Science VM on Azure</title><link>//blog.anoff.io/2018-03-22-dev-workflow-datascience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//blog.anoff.io/2018-03-22-dev-workflow-datascience/</guid><description>tl;dr; I put together a bunch of scripts on Github that let you deploy a VM from your command line as well as sync code from your local directory to the VM easily to be able to use local IDE and git but execute on the powerful remote machine. Perfect for Data Science applications based around jupyter notebook.
In my previous blog post I explained how to do Terraform deployment of an Azure Data Science Virtual Machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
