With this post I want to share my experience setting up a dedicated CI runner infrastructure with the Azure + Pipelines ecosystem. The main features of the solution are automated scaling, ephemeral build agents, docker based environments, minimal operation responsible and strong pay-per-use billing concepts.</description></item><item><title>Migrating to vuetify 2.1</title><link>//localhost:5000/2019-10-migrating-vuetify-1-to-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//localhost:5000/2019-10-migrating-vuetify-1-to-2/</guid><description>I just migrated the code for the devradar editor to the latest major version of vuetify. There is an officiel migration guide that helped me solve 70% of the issues but here is a quick overview of the biggest issues I encountered and what actually changed.

Due to some tasks with Azure DevOps at work I wanted to test how good it fits my private projects. In this post I will NOT tell you how to set up your pipelines project because Microsoft has great docs for that. Instead this post will cover how to best put your build workflow into a pipeline specification.</description></item><item><title>Reference GitHub #issues during git rebase</title><link>//localhost:5000/2019-07-20-git-config-rebase-github-issue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//localhost:5000/2019-07-20-git-config-rebase-github-issue/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Being a developer most times means working with git.
There are many different ways to use git and every project, every developer has their preferences.
For my own projects I work a lot with GitHub and I love using the &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; feature to clean up commits.&lt;/p&gt;

It will show you some techniques you can use to compose the navigation menu in a multi-repository, multi-module setup.
This is especially interesting if you have content spread across repositories that you want to present hierarchically in the navigation tree.&lt;/p&gt;

My previous post blog.anoff.io/2019-02-15-antora-first-steps covered basics of Antora and how to migrate existing AsciiDoc files. In this post I will go through the steps of including content from another repository, building a custom UI and adding plantUML support to the (automated, dockerized) build.
plantUML supportOne of the most important things for me when it comes to software docs is the ability to show relationships and interactions using diagrams.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Vitae - Auto built and git versioned CV</title><link>//localhost:5000/2019-04-08-cv-continuous-vitae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//localhost:5000/2019-04-08-cv-continuous-vitae/</guid><description>Versioning your CV is important. One traditional approach is to date it whenever you send it out. I chose to present my CV on my website and host it on GitHub. In this blog post I want to explain how I set up continuous integration pipeline for building my CV that automatically injects a unique version into each build. This method is applicable for anyone choosing to ascii-based CV - in my case LaTeX.</description></item><item><title>Hosting Gitea and Drone with Docker</title><link>//localhost:5000/2019-03-24-self-hosted-gitea-drone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//localhost:5000/2019-03-24-self-hosted-gitea-drone/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post will walk you through setting up a self hosted git based continuous integration environment on a two machine setup - assuming you already have two virtual machines at your disposal.
Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitea.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gitea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for git hosting and contribution management and &lt;a href=&#34;https://drone.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for docker-based build jobs, this will guide you through creating &lt;strong&gt;docker-compose&lt;/strong&gt; files as well as configuring the individual services and getting &lt;strong&gt;SSL certificates&lt;/strong&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://traefik.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;traefik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Docker and docker-compose knowledge is required for this tutorial. It mostly focuses on the correct configuration of all the services at play here and not explaining their basic functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial uses Azure resources so some of the aspects might not be 100% applicable if you chose another infrastructure provider.&lt;/p&gt;

While setup and migration to Hugo was a breeze, I spent a lot of time making my .adoc formatted post work with the new blog.

The main reason for the interest in AsciiDoc was the fact that the limited feature set in markdown often impairs you while writing down complex things. But I had one problem; most of our documentation is scattered across multiple repositories as we try to keep the docs as close to the code as possible.</description></item><item><title>RBAC with Google Firestore</title><link>//localhost:5000/2018-08-12-rbac-firestore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//localhost:5000/2018-08-12-rbac-firestore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post will explain how to implement role based access control (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control&#34;&gt;RBAC&lt;/a&gt;) using the Google Firestore serverless database.
